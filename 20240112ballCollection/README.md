### Ball Collection

The `20240112ballCollection` folder contains files for a web-based ball collection exercise, allowing users to interact with a collection of balls displayed on a webpage. Users can create balls, control their movement, and experiment with various interactive features.

#### HTML File: `ballJ.html`

This file serves as the main entry point for the ball collection exercise. It provides the user interface elements for creating balls, controlling their behavior, and interacting with the collection. Users can specify the number of balls to create, control their movement, and trigger additional effects using buttons provided in the control panel.

#### JavaScript File: `ballJ.js`

The JavaScript file contains the logic and functionality for creating, controlling, and updating the behavior of the balls. It defines functions for creating balls with random parameters, updating their positions based on velocity and gravity, and handling collisions with the walls of the container. Additionally, it includes functions for controlling ball movement, such as acceleration, deceleration, and randomization of movement.

#### CSS File: `ballJ.css`

The CSS file contains styles to visually enhance the ball collection exercise. It defines styles for the container holding the balls, individual ball elements, and the control panel interface. The styles ensure proper positioning, sizing, and visual effects for a smooth and engaging user experience.

### Usage

1. Open the `ballJ.html` file in a web browser.
2. Use the input field to specify the number of balls to create.
3. Click the "Create" button to generate the specified number of balls.
4. Use the control panel buttons to manipulate ball movement and trigger additional effects.
5. Experiment with different settings and interactions to explore the behavior of the ball collection.

### Additional Notes

- The exercise is designed to provide a hands-on experience with interactive web elements and demonstrate principles of ball movement and collision detection.
- Users can customize the exercise by adjusting parameters such as ball count, velocity, and acceleration to observe different behaviors.
- The exercise serves as a learning tool for understanding basic concepts of animation, user interaction, and visual effects in web development.

Feel free to explore and experiment with the ball collection exercise to enhance your understanding of web-based interactions and animations!
