    - Creates balls with random colors, sizes, positions, and velocities.
    - Implements boundary detection to reverse ball movement upon hitting the container edges.
    - Utilizes CSS properties for ball appearance and position, enhancing performance.
    - Utilizes `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth and efficient animation.
- **Usage:** Designed to be paired with `indexRM.html` for a dynamic and visually appealing animation experience.

#### JavaScript File: `ballRMO.js`

- **Purpose:** Similar to `ballRM.js`, this JavaScript file focuses on creating and animating random balls with additional features or optimizations.
- **Key Features:**
    - Creates multiple balls with random colors, sizes, positions, and velocities.
    - Utilizes CSS for ball appearance and position manipulation, enhancing performance.
    - Implements boundary detection for smooth ball movement within the container.
